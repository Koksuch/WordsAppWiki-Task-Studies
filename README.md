# WordsApp Wiki

[Live Demo](https://curious-longma-096ceb.netlify.app/)

The site was created as part of an assignment in college. The assignment was to create a UI of any “wiki” type page having a search bar when clicked, which would display a “loading” element created in html canvas.

The idea behind WordsApp was a wiki page where we can search for definitions and synonyms of a word. Currently, it would be enough to plug in the appropriate api to make the page fully functional. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find any fully free api that would provide this.
